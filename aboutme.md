My name is Lam Duy Khang. I have been a student at Ho Chi Minh University of Technology (HCMUT) from 2018. The field that I want to pursue now is Computer Vision. 

### My story

I used to be not aware of who I would be in the future and what I need to do in my adventure. Thanks for a friend, I seem to be woken up and I really want to find the answer to these questions above. At school, Math is my favorite subject, and that may be one of the reasons that I decide to pursue AI. Hope that my blog can help someone to realize their passion and come to the end of the road.
